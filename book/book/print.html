<p><img src="./images/example.png" alt="Line of Sight Example" title="An example of what we are trying to do" /></p>
<p>It is common when simulating two-dimensional worlds (i.e. for video games) to want to determine line of sight from a specific point \(P\). That is, we'd like to find (a reasonable approximation to) the set of points \(Q\) such that the line \(\vec{PQ}\) does not pass through any solid objects. There are a few great articles that already talk about various approaches to this problem. In particular, the three linked below in the references section were used in various capacities during the formulation of the approach given here.</p>
<p>There are two theoretical complaints one might raise about the existing implementations. Firstly, one method purposefully excludes small slices of area that should be marked as visible near corners of wall segments. Secondly, they often feature (potentially) expensive operations such as (inverse) trigonometric functions or square roots, and the explanations of portions of the algorithm can lack intuition. In practice, these generally run quickly enough for what we need. Just because a given operation is expensive in theory doesn't mean that an alternate approach avoiding it will be faster in practice. Additionally, close enough is generally good enough for most use cases. All those being said, however, it is still worthwhile to see what can be done to address these concerns.</p>
<p>As such, we give an algorithm here which we attempt to explain in straightforward fashion using vectors. It only uses arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and a few divisions. This is intended more as an exercise in using vectors rather than any attempts to create production ready code. Familiarity with vector basics such as vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product will be necessary. I recommend that serious projects use one of the algorithms listed in the references, as they are likely to be more battle-tested and stable. Here we do not handle floating point errors with much care, and we could signifcantly improve how we sort and iterate through structures.</p>
<p>The code samples and associated repo are written in Rust, however our code should be relatively language-agnostic for anyone with some experience with C-style syntax. </p>

<div id="chapter_begin" style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-problem"><a class="header" href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h1>
<p>We are given a point \(P\) in space and an angle \(0&lt;\theta\leq\pi\) and direction \(\vec{v}\). Our goal is to bound the region that can be seen from \(P\) while looking in the direction of \(\vec{v}\) with field of view \(\theta\). Our eyesight is not bounded by distance. (See [<a href="https://legends2k.github.io/2d-fov/design.html">2</a>] for a treatment where the distance is bounded.)</p>
<p><img src="./images/problem.png" alt="Problem Setup" title="An example problem" /></p>
<p>As our over-arching goal is to avoid using trigonometric functions, we will not actually use an angle and viewing direction to represent the problem. Instead, we shall store two vectors which bound the viewing region: \(\vec{l}\) (for &quot;lower&quot;) and \(\vec{u}\) (for &quot;upper&quot;).</p>
<p><img src="./images/problemvectors.png" alt="Problem Revision" title="The example redefined using u and l" /></p>
<p>For our function to work, we need \(P\), \(\vec{l}\), \(\vec{u}\), and a list of line segments which represent all of the solid objects we can't see through. How you generate this list will depend on what shapes you are using to define your objects and which objects should and should not block vision. For the sake of efficiency, it might be worthwhile to store all static line segments (such as those coming from walls) and update only dynamic line segments (such as those coming from characters) each frame.</p>
<h1 id="solution-outline"><a class="header" href="#solution-outline">Solution Outline</a></h1>
<p>We shall split the problem into three discrete steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Send out rays from \(P\) which slice the viewing angle into triangles. </li>
<li>Sort the rays so that the ray defined via \(\vec{l}\) is the least and they increase by angle towards \(\vec{u}\).</li>
<li>Determine how far along each ray we should travel and use that to define the triangles whose union is the visible area.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will cover each step in its own section, first covering the math behind the code then walking through the code itself. We will also provide test code to verify that our math and code are behaving like we expect them to. In general we shall assume that our given vectors are non-zero while we are theory-crafting.</p>
<div id="chapter_begin" style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sending-out-rays"><a class="header" href="#sending-out-rays">Sending out Rays</a></h1>
<p>As observed in our references, an initial, naive approach to the line of sight problem is to simply cast out a large number of rays that slice our viewing area into small sections. We then measure the closest point where each ray intersects a line segment and connect the dots. </p>
<p><img src="./images/lotsofrays.png" alt="Casting Rays" title="Sending out a bunch of rays" /></p>
<p>For some use cases this approach might be good enough. However, it has a fatal flaw: the only way to improve its accuracy is to send out more and more rays. This increases the amount of computations we need to do drastically for increasingly limited improvements in accuracy. </p>
<p>Fortunately, we can be more circumspect in how we send out rays. Instead of shooting them out indiscriminately, we shall throw one in the direction of \(\vec{l}\), one in the direction of \(\vec{u}\), and one in the direction of each endpoint of each line segment. </p>
<p><img src="./images/justendpoints.png" alt="Rays to Segment Endpoints" title="Only send rays to segment endpoints" /></p>
<p>For this to work, we need to be able to tell whether or not a ray generated in this manner is within our viewing area. If it isn't, then we should not add it to our list, as any further computations on it are unnecessary. The most straightforward way to do this would be to measure the angle of each ray, and determine if its angle is between the angles of \(\vec{l}\) and \(\vec{u}\). However, our goal is to implement a line of sight algorithm without resorting to expensive operations like arctangent, so we'll handle this exclusion using vectors instead.</p>
<h2 id="rejecting-rays"><a class="header" href="#rejecting-rays">Rejecting Rays</a></h2>
<p>We want to use vectors to reject rays which live in the shaded region below.</p>
<p><img src="./images/sightregion.png" alt="Sight Region" title="Region between u and l" /></p>
<p>This region is the combination of two half-planes: the half-plane \(L\), which is all of the points to the right of the line defined by \(\vec{l}\), and the half-plane \(U\), which is all the points to the left of the line defined by \(\vec{u}\).</p>
<p><img src="./images/ulhalfplanes.png" alt="U and L" title="U and L" /></p>
<p>If a ray lies in either one of these planes, then we want to exclude it. We can use <i>normal</i> vectors to do this. A normal vector \(\hat{n}\) of a line defined via a vector \(\vec{n}\) is a vector which is perpendicular to the line, i.e. such that \(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{n} = 0\). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is analgous to the normal vector of a plane in three dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each line has two normal directions: the first, \(\hat{n}_{CCW}\), is obtained by rotating \(\vec{n}\) by \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) in the counterclockwise direction, and the other, \(\hat{n}_{CW}\), is obtained by rotating in the same amount in the clockwise direction. Any vector \(\vec{a}\) to the left of the line defined by \(\vec{n}\) will satisfy \(\vec{a}\cdot\hat{n}_{CCW}&gt;0\), and any vector \(\vec{b}\) to the right of the line defined by \(\vec{n}\) will satisfy \(\vec{b}\cdot\hat{n}_{CW}&gt;0\).</p>
<p><img src="./images/normalvectors.png" alt="Normal Vectors" title="Normal vectors for a given line" /></p>
<p>We can use this to reject the rays outside of our desired region. Given a vector \(\vec{r}\) representing one of our potential rays, we will compute \(\hat{u}_{CCW}\cdot\vec{r}\) and \(\hat{l}_{CW}\cdot\vec{r}\). If the first quantity is positive, then we know \(\vec{r}\) is inside \(U\). If the second quantity is positive, then we know \(\vec{r}\) is inside \(L\). In either case, it is not in the region we are looking for and we exclude it from our search. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this to work, it is important that the angle between \(\vec{l}\) and \(\vec{u}\) is no larger than \(\pi\). However, we can process angles larger than \(\pi\) by applying this process to the complement angle and negating the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The careful reader might have an objection to this process: rotating vectors sounds like trigonometry. Fortunately, as we're only rotating by right angles, we can avoid using any trig whatsoever! Given \(\vec{n}=\langle p,q\rangle\), we can compute the normal vectors via \(\hat{n}_{CCW}=\langle-q,p\rangle\) and \(\hat{n}_{CW}=\langle q,-p\rangle\). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The skeptical reader can verify these facts using rotation matrices or by thinking of vectors as complex numbers and performing multiplication by \(i\) and \(-i\) respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="putting-this-into-practice"><a class="header" href="#putting-this-into-practice">Putting This Into Practice</a></h2>
<p>Below is the actual code that handles this ray rejection  process. <code>Point</code> is a simple struct with floating point values for its components <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. We use this struct to represent both points in space and vectors. The <code>ray_between</code> function is a member of this struct which checks if the vector is between the provided values for <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code>. <code>FLOATING_POINT_ERROR</code> should be thought of as basically zero. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Floating point comparisons are a notoriously fickle issue best avoided by allowing for small amounts of error, which is why we do not compare to <code>0.0</code>. We have defined <code>FLOATING_POINT_ERROR</code> to be <code>0.0001</code>, although there is no specific rational behind this compared to other arbitrary values like <code>0.001</code> or <code>0.00001</code>. </p>

<p>The only pieces of this code that might cause some confusion are the dot product calculations. Rather than adding overhead by allocating new <code>Point</code>s for the normal vectors and calling the dot product function on them, we perform the calculations manually to save time. This is done using the characterization of the normal vectors described in the last paragraph of the previous section.</p>

<p>We create a new vector (Rust's version of a resizable array) to store our rays in, then add <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code> to it. From here, we iterate over each <code>segment</code> in the vector of <code>Segement</code>s which is passed into the function. <code>Segment</code> is a struct simply containing a <code>start</code> <code>Point</code> and an <code>end</code> <code>Point</code>. For each <code>segment</code>, we generate a ray between our location and both endpoints. We use <code>ray_between</code> to only accept rays which are between <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code> in our collection.</p>
<p>Now we're ready to move on to the second part of our algorithm: sorting this collection of rays by angle.</p>
<h2 id="potential-improvements"><a class="header" href="#potential-improvements">Potential Improvements</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>If your line segments define a sensible collection of closed polygons, then we can skip the second ray portion because each point should be the beginninng of some line segment.</li>
<li>Before adding rays to our collection, we could additionally check to ensure that we are not adding in multiple rays which point in the same direction, as these will be redundant. This suggestion has been omitted from the included code to avoid generating a debate about what the best data structure(s) for handling such behavior might be.</li>
</ol>
<div id="chapter_begin" style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sortine-by-angle"><a class="header" href="#sortine-by-angle">Sortine by Angle</a></h1>
<p><img src="./images/unsorted.png" alt="Unsorted list of rays" title="Our collection of rays unsorted" /></p>
<p>At this point, we've created a collection of rays emanating from \(P\). Our goal will be to find where these rays intersect with the line segments blocking our view, and then connect the adjacent intersection points to create a sequence of triangles which represent our field of view. To do this, we'll need to sort our collection of rays via increasing angle so that we'll know which rays are neighbors.</p>
<p><img src="./images/sorted.png" alt="Sorted list of rays" title="Our collection of rays now sorted" /></p>
<h2 id="sorting-by-vector-components"><a class="header" href="#sorting-by-vector-components">Sorting by Vector Components</a></h2>
<p>We're going to use dot products to avoid computing angles. Recall that, given two vectors \(\vec{n}\) and \(\vec{m}\), the component of \(\vec{n}\) in the direction of \(\vec{m}\) is given by \(\frac{\vec{n}\cdot\vec{m}}{|\vec{m}|}\).</p>
<p><img src="./images/projection.png" alt="Vector projection" title="An example of vector projection" /></p>
<p>Consider two of our rays defined by vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), which we know lie between \(\vec{l}\) and \(\vec{u}\). As such, we kow that both the angle \(\theta_a\) between \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{l}\) and the angle \(\theta_b\) between \(\vec{b}\) and \(\vec{l}\) does not exceed \(\pi\) since the angle between \(\vec{l}\) and \(\vec{u}\) does not exceed \(\pi\). If all of our rays are defined by unit vectors, i.e. have length \(1\), we know that \(\theta_a\) is larger than \(\theta_b\) if and only if the component of \(\vec{a}\) in the direction of \(\vec{l}\) is <em>smaller</em> than the component of \(\vec{b}\) in the direction of \(\vec{l}\). In other words, we can sort unit vectors by increasing angle if we sort by <em>decreasing</em> components.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unit_vectors.png" alt="Unit vectors" title="Comparing unit vector components" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can extend this for viewing angles greater than \(\pi\) by also considering the components along \(\hat{b}_{CCW}\). All of the rays with positive components along the normal vector come first and are sorted as described above. Then we include the rays with negative components along the normal vector, which need to be sorted in reverse. (That is, increasing components along \(\vec{l}\) correspond to increasing angles once we pass the angle \(\pi\).)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the time our rays will not be given by unit vectors. We could compute the unit vectors, but that would require that we compute the inverse square root of the length. We could use the notorious (and notoriously opaque) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">Fast Inverse Square Root Function</a>, but we shall instead use algebra to come up with a simpler solution for the sake of clarity. Let's write down the inequality we want to check:
\[\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{l}}{|\vec{a}||\vec{l}|}&gt;\frac{\vec{b}\cdot\vec{l}}{|\vec{b}||\vec{l}|}\]
Here the factors of \(|\vec{a}|\) and \(|\vec{b}|\) in the denominators come from getting the components of the unit vectors in the direction of \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), not of \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) themselves. We can cancel \(|\vec{l}|\), leaving us with
\[\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{l}}{|\vec{a}|}&gt;\frac{\vec{b}\cdot\vec{l}}{|\vec{b}|}\]
We multiply to rewrite this as
\[(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{l})|\vec{b}|&gt;(\vec{b}\cdot\vec{l})|\vec{a}|\]
Now, we can apply a common trick: \(n &gt; m\) if and only if \(n|n| &gt; m|m|\). This is because the function \(y=x|x|=sign(x)*x^2\) flips the left half of the parabola \(y=x^2\) upside down to make it an increasing function. Thus, we can now consider the inequality
\[(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{l})*|\vec{a}\cdot\vec{l}|*|\vec{b}|^2&gt;(\vec{b}\cdot\vec{l})*|\vec{b}\cdot\vec{l}|*|\vec{a}|^2\]
This is something we can represent in code using just addition and multiplication.</p>
<h2 id="putting-this-into-practice-1"><a class="header" href="#putting-this-into-practice-1">Putting This Into Practice</a></h2>
<p>We can calculate these quantities quite easily. Given <code>lower</code> as a <code>Point</code> as well as two <code>Point</code>s <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that we wish to compare, we can write the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>			//We want to order by angle from lower, which is the same as reverse ordering by normalized projections along lower
			//We do some algebra to avoid computing square roots for the normalization, i.e. a dot L/|a|&gt;b dot L/|b| if and only if
			// a dot L*|a dot L|*|b|^2 &gt; b dot L * |b dot L| * |a|^2
			let a_dot_l = lower.dot(a);
			let lhs = a_dot_l.abs() * a_dot_l * (b.x * b.x + b.y * b.y);

			let b_dot_l = lower.dot(b);
			let rhs = b_dot_l.abs() * b_dot_l * (a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Comparing these two values and using that to sort our list of rays will be language dependent. In Rust, the <code>Vec</code> type includes the convenient <code>sort_by</code> and <code>sort_unstable_by</code> (generally the faster of the two)  methods. These allow us to pass a closure which defines an ordering on the elements for us, and the <code>Vec</code> will then sort itself according to that ordering. We'll define an associated method for the <code>Point</code> struct to do just this using the above calculations.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>	//Works so long as all represented angles are between lower and lower+pi
	pub fn sort_from_angle(rays: &amp;mut Vec&lt;Point&gt;, lower: Point)
	{

		rays.sort_unstable_by(|a, b|
		{

			//We want to order by angle from lower, which is the same as reverse ordering by normalized projections along lower
			//We do some algebra to avoid computing square roots for the normalization, i.e. a dot L/|a|&gt;b dot L/|b| if and only if
			// a dot L*|a dot L|*|b|^2 &gt; b dot L * |b dot L| * |a|^2
			let a_dot_l = lower.dot(a);
			let lhs = a_dot_l.abs() * a_dot_l * (b.x * b.x + b.y * b.y);

			let b_dot_l = lower.dot(b);
			let rhs = b_dot_l.abs() * b_dot_l * (a.x * a.x + a.y * a.y);
			return rhs.partial_cmp(&amp;lhs).unwrap();

		});

	}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here we are given a list of <code>Point</code>s which represent our rays and a <code>Point</code> for <code>lower</code>. We declare the list as mutable so that we can sort it. Then we simply call <code>sort_unstable_by</code> with our custom closure. Notice that we return <code>rhs.partial_cmp(&amp;lhs)</code> as opposed to <code>lhs.partial_cmp(&amp;rhs)</code>. This is making Rust reverse the order relation between the two values as discussed above. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> and <code>.unwrap()</code> in the above code is Rust specific and is not particularly relevant to our algorithm, just necessary minutiae to make the code compile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We again provide a test to double-check that our code works as expected.</p>
